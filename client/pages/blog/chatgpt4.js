                    What is ChatGPT?
                </p>
                <p className='text-white'>
                    ChatGPT is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI, one of the world's leading AI research institutes. It is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, which uses a deep neural network to analyze large amounts of text data and generate human-like responses to natural language queries.

                <p className='text-white'>
                    ChatGPT is trained on a diverse range of text sources, including websites, books, and news articles. This allows it to generate responses that are not only accurate but also contextually appropriate and grammatically correct.

                    How does ChatGPT work?
                </p>
                <p className='text-white'>
                    ChatGPT works by using a deep neural network to analyze and understand the structure and meaning of human language. This network is trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing it to recognize patterns and relationships between words and phrases.
                </p>
                <p className='text-white'>
                    When a user inputs a query or question, ChatGPT uses its neural network to analyze the input and generate a response based on its understanding of the context and meaning of the query. This response is then presented to the user in a natural and human-like way, making it easy to understand and interact with.
