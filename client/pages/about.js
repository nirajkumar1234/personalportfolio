                                <p className="font-sans text-white">I was an accomplished web developer, having completed a plethora of web development projects. One particular project I worked on during my college years in 2021 which involved building an online room finder, which was aimed at solving the problem of finding rooms.</p>
                                <p className="font-sans text-white mt-2">Initially, I was tasked with designing the user interface of the website as a front-end developer. However, my colleagues had to leave the project midway due to board exams, leaving me alone to handle both front-end and back-end development.</p>
                                <p className="font-sans text-white mt-2">To tackle the challenge, I had to teach myself PHP, the programming language needed for back-end development. Despite encountering difficulties in debugging and coding, I persevered and eventually succeeded in developing a fully functional website.</p>
                                <p className="font-sans text-white mt-2">
                                    Overall, the experience taught me valuable lessons in adaptability and problem-solving, and solidified my passion for web development.
